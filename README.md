The aim of this project is to design and implement a computerized system to help CECS
students with co-ops (internships for credit). Employers post internship positions. Students
look for and apply for internships. Students belong to various departments. Each department
has a faculty co-op coordinator that validates co-ops and enter grades for students at the end
of their co-op experience

Project Description
All external entities are mentioned in bold in the following description.
Login pages should be provided for all users.
Employers create company profiles in the portal. Each company profile includes company name,
location, Link to web site, contact person’s full name, contact person’s email, contact person’s phone
number. Each employer is assigned a unique employee ID.
Employers submit internship entries to the portal. Each job entry includes employer ID, Job title, job
description, number of weeks, number of hours per week, job location (can be remote as well), majors
of interest, required skills, preferred skills, and salary information. Each position is automatically
assigned a unique ID. A position is either open (still accepting applications), pending (an offer is being
processed), or closed. Employers may have any number of open positions.
Faculty serve as co-op coordinators for their department. There is one co-op coordinator per
department. Each coordinator creates a profile in the portal. The profile includes the faculty’s full name,
email address, and home department.
Students create student profiles in the portal. Each student profile includes the student’s full name,
email address, phone number, department, major, number of credit hours completed in the major, GPA,
semester/year they started their academic program, whether the student is a transfer student or not.
They may upload their resume and update it at any time. Each student is automatically assigned a
unique ID in the system.
Students search for internships of interest based on one or multiple criteria (e.g., employer, etc.). You
are required to include at least three (3) possible criteria in the search form.
Students apply for any internship of interest. The system keeps track of all internships each student
applied for.
Employers have access to all applicants for any of their positions. They can view all applicants’
information, including their resumes. They review applications and conduct interviews (outside the
scope of the project). Once a candidate is selected for the position, the employer marks the position as
pending. While marking positions as pending, employers provide the ID of the selected student and
offer letters.
Every time a student is selected for an internship, the system executes the following process to
determine whether the student is eligible to earn credit for the internship (i.e., co-op):
Co-op Eligibility
“To be eligible for co-op, the student must have a minimum 2.0 GPA and
the internship should be for at least 7 weeks for a total of at least 140
hours throughout the duration of the internship. If the student is a
transfer students, then they must have completed at least one semester
to be eligible for co-op. Otherwise, they must have completed at least
two semesters of courses at the college.”
An email is sent to all selected students that are eligible for co-op. Eligible Students interested in co-op
(i.e., getting a 1 course credit for the internship) should indicate that in the portal.
Students that are not eligible for co-op or are not interested in a co-op do NOT have to do anything
further in the portal. They will do their internship as offered by the employer without getting course
credit.
At the end of the internship, co-op students should login to the portal and provide a short co-op
summary (in text format) about their internship in order to receive course credit for the co-op.
Faculty co-op coordinators may login at any time to view co-op students in their department. They also
review the co-op summary submitted by co-op students and enter a grade for the student in the portal.
